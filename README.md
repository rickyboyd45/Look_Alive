# Look Alive


# Project Description
With this project I will be choosing 4 cities in the US and pulling the information for upcoming musical events from the Ticketmaster API.  On the home page I will allow the users to voice their excitment for the upcoming events, as well. Hence the name "Look Alive" and enjoy the upcoming events!
